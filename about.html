                <p>Hi! My name is Ian. I've only recently stumbled onto this new passion, and I'm keen on diving in
                    head first to learn as much about the world of web development as I possibly can. When I'm not
                    stuffing my face with new content, I'll at work (shocker, yeah?), a few choice spots
                    sprinkled about Austin or at home binge watching some random irreverent comedy for the 12th
                    time. <h5 class="text-secondary project-header">Here are some projects I have been apart of.</h5>
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="job job-1">
                <h3>Space Jam</h3>
                <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
                <p>I was placed in a team that was given the opportunity to decide what kind of application we would
                    like to build. Ultimately, we agreed music was something we were all passionate about and something
                    we would enjoy designing an app around. Due our experience at the time we were limited in the scope
                    of our application, but the idea was still interesting to build around. I was tasked with designing
                    and implementing the vast majority of the look and structure of the site itself. Check out my work
                    page to view the website.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="job job-2">
                <h3>Grandma's Attic</h3>
                <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
                <p>This application was designed around the idea that people have a lot of junk and it can be quite a
                    hassle to get pack up and move all of this junk. Some people don't have the patience or time to
                    nickel and dime people for old trinkets and household items. In comes Grandma's Attic. All users
                    need do is input what kind of item they are trying to get rid of and their location, and someone
                    can claim those items. My job was primarily centered around setting up the server to hold client's
                    item information, as well as implementing the API (called Cloudinary) to store images in a separate
                    database.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="job job-3">
                <h3>App-a-Day</h3>
                <h6>Full Stack Developer</h6>
                <p>This application was a culmination of everything I and my classmates had learned over the course of
                    our class. The idea behind it was simply that it's hard to remember all of this new information, we
                    need ways to keep all this knowledge fresh. App-a-Day was our answer. Once users login, they are
                    allowed to participate in a few Javascript oriented activites. The first are small step by step
                    instructional javascript coding sections. The second activity is video page allowing for searches
                    specific to javascript. I very much took both a leadership role this project. I designed the look
                    and feel of the app. I built the foundation, and delegated activities to other team members to
                    ensure there was nobody working on the same code. I implemented many of the technologies such as
                    Redux, Express, Mongoose, React-Router, and ReactStrap. I managed the Github Repo, and I connected
                    the app to Heroku.</p>
